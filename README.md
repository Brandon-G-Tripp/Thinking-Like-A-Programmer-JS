# Solutions to Problems from Thinking Like A Programmer

### Approach to Working through the Book

I am a Javascript developer so I am approaching the book as such and transforming the problems into issues to be solved in my language of choice. Because of the higher level of abstraction in Javascript some of the problems may decrease in difficulty. Such as reading characters from input. At the same time, I see an opportunity to diversify my understanding of coding in general by transforming the problems from one language to another and viewing the differences in implementation. I believe this will lead to a better understanding of Javascript while also getting a taste of C++.
